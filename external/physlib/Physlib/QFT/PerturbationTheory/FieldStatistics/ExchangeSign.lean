# Exchange sign for field statistics

Suppose we have two fields `φ` and `ψ`, and the term `φψ`, if we swap them
`ψφ`, we may pick up a sign. This sign is called the exchange sign.
This sign is `-1` if both fields `ψ` and `φ` are fermionic and `1` otherwise.

In this module we define the exchange sign for general field statistics,
and prove some properties of it. Importantly:
- It is symmetric `exchangeSign_symm`.
- When multiplied with itself it is `1` `exchangeSign_mul_self`.
- It is a cocycle `exchangeSign_cocycle`.

/-- The exchange sign, `exchangeSign`, is defined as the group homomorphism

  `FieldStatistic →* FieldStatistic →* ℂ`,

  for which `exchangeSign a b` is `-1` if both `a` and `b` are `fermionic` and `1` otherwise.
  The exchange sign is the sign one picks up on exchanging an operator or field `φ₁` of statistic
  `a` with an operator or field `φ₂` of statistic `b`, i.e. `φ₁φ₂ → φ₂φ₁`.

  The notation `𝓢(a, b)` is used for the exchange sign of `a` and `b`. -/
