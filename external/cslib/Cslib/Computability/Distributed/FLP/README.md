# Impossibility of asynchronous distributed consensus

This directory contains a formalization of Völzer's proof [Volzer2004] of the famous result in
distributed computing, first proved by Fischer, Lynch and Paterson [FLP1985], that asynchronous
distributed consensus is impossible in the presence of even a single crash fault.

## Lean files

1. `Algorithm.lean` defines the "syntax" of a distributed algorithm for solving the consensus problem
   and proves some basic properties.

2. `Consensus.lean` defines what it means for a distributed algorithm to solve the consensus problem
   in a fault-tolerant way and proves some basic properties.

3. `FairScheduler.lean` contains a technical machinery for constructing "fair executions", which is used
    in the proof of `PseudoConsensus.of_consensus` in `PseudoConsensus.lean` and in the proof of
    `OnePseudoConsensus.fair_nonUniform` in `Impossibility.lean`.

4. `CanReachVia.lean` defines the notion of reachability via a subset of processes and proves some of
   its properties.

5. `PseudoConsensus.lean` defines the notion of a fault-tolerant "pseudo-consensus" algorithm, which
   is central to Völzer's proof, and proves that every `f`-tolerant consensus algorithm is also a
   `f`-tolerant pseudo-consensus algorithm.

6. `OnePseudoConsensus.lean` focuses on 1-tolerant pseudo-consensus algorithms, defines the key notion
   of "nonuniformity", and proves a number of their properties.

7. `Impossibility.lean` proves that every 1-tolerant pseudo-consensus algorithm has a fair execution
   which doesn't contain any fault but never reaches a consensus, which then implies that there cannot
   be a consensus algorithm that can tolerate even a single fault.

8. `ZeroConsensus.lean` presents a simple distributed consensus algorithm and proves that it achieves
   consensus if there is no fault.  This file is not needed for proving the impossibility result, but is
   included to show that the notion of an algorithm defined in `Algorithm.lean` is not vacuous, in the
   sense that it allows a working consensus algorithm when there is no fault.

Files #1 and #2 contains materials common to both [FLP1985] and [Volzer2004].
File #3 provides proof details that are either completely omitted (in the case of
`PseudoConsensus.of_consensus`) or only hinted at (in the case of
`OnePseudoConsensus.fair_nonUniform`) in [Volzer2004].
The remaining files (except #8) follow the development in [Volzer2004] fairly closely,
as is explained further in each file.
